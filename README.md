# Maze Demo terminal

## Start the app

```
npm install
npm start
```

Select a start position.

Check the way of the player through the maze

## Applied algorithm

To find a way through the maze step by step these algorithms are applied:

- Recursion (to do next move => one recursion level down)
- Backtracking (to allow moving one step back if we are lost => one recursion level up)

## Your custom maze

Copy the file "maze.example.js" to a file "maze.js"

Adapt the maze in the maze.js

Use pipe bars | to place obstacles for player.

Enjoyyyyy little grasshopper...
